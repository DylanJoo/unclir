## Sparse retrieval (bm25) baseline  
---
In this document, we provide the procedure for sparse retrieval baseline.
We use pyserini toolkit and its implemeneted indexing/searching infrastructure. 

### Corpus prepration
First, we need to transform the corpus into the `.jsonl` format. 
which is compatible with pyserini. 

### Indexing
For NeuCLIR dataset, please follow the following codes.

For MIRACL dataset, we downalod directly from [Pyserini prebuilt indexes]().
You can also do it yourself follow the [instructions]() in the repo.


### Searching
